        const message = `I’ve been waiting for this day to tell you something I’ve been carrying in my heart for 169 days. 

Ever since we started talking, you’ve become so much more than a friend—you’ve become my healer. You’ve mended scars I never spoke about, and you’ve turned every "Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday" after college into the absolute highlights of my week.

I cherish every little thing about us. Whether it’s walking together to the bus stop or those quiet moments where I find myself just staring at you, completely lost in how beautiful you are—every second with you matters. Your voice messages are my favorite sound, and when you send me your photos and videos without me even asking, it’s the best part of my day. Those little glimpses into your world, along with your texts, are my "notifications of happiness." Your smile alone makes my entire day beautiful.

I chose this bouquet because, just like you, every flower has a special power:

The Red Rose: This represents True Love. Just as its color is deep and bold, my love for you is sincere. I promise to always give you a love that is brave, honest, and never-ending.

The White Rose: This represents Purity and New Beginnings. It’s my promise to always treat you with the utmost respect and to make every new day we share better than the last.

The Daisy: This represents Loyal Love. I promise to stay by your side through every high and low, giving you a loyalty that never wavers and a shoulder you can always lean on.

The Sunflower: This represents Adoration and Strength. Just as it follows the sun, my eyes and my heart will always follow you. I promise to put in the effort to keep your world bright and filled with warmth.

The Pink Tulip: This represents Perfect Affection. It’s my way of saying that to me, you are perfect. I promise to cherish you and care for your heart with everything I have.

I am deeply, truly in love with you. I don’t just want to be the guy you walk to the bus stop with; I want to be the person who gives you his whole heart and unlimited effort.

For your birthday, I have one sincere request: Please, give me just one chance. Give me the chance to show you that I can be the person who loves you best. Give me the chance to be the reason you smile, just like you are the reason for mine.

Happy Birthday to the girl who changed my world.

With all my love and devotion,
Lanishhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh`;
